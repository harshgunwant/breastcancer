# BREAST CANCER CLASSIFICATION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION.
This code helps you to identify a tumor as benign or malign.

#CODE REQUIREMENTS

The example code was coded in jupyter and downloaded as a .py file.
You can install Anaconda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

#DESCRIPTION

 Despite having the name regression, logistic regression is a Classifier.
 It is an advanced version of linear regression used for classification between classes.

 The logistic function, also called the sigmoid function was developed by statisticians to describe properties of population growth in     ecology, rising quickly and maxing out at the carrying capacity of the environment. Itâ€™s an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued  number and map it into a value between 0 and 1, but never exactly at those limits.

#PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION

1.Dataset- UCI-ML
2.I have used 9 features to classify
3.Instead of 0=benign and 1=malignant, I have used 2=benign and 4=malignant

#ACCURACY~96%
